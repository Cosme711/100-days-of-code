### Day 0: November 24, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Learned about new features of Vue3 like Composition API and teleport. I use provide / inject for the first time. I improve my skills in Scss for have a more readable and dynamic css file. 

**Thoughts:** Vue Dev Tools browser extensions doesn't work in Vue3. I can more use the functionality Attribute Selector in CSS.
